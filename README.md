# ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IN THIS REPOSITORY IS MADE FOR USAGE, IT WILL BREAK HORRIBLY. ABSOLUTELY DO NOT USE

Development playground for reading and writing the ER FXR format

* `git submodule update --init` to get SoulsFormats
* Run the app
* The app tries to read, then write, then compare all ER 1.07 fxr files in order.
* It will likely fail on file 1.
* Now your `bin/Debug` folder will have the saved FXR in `/effectOutput`.
* Open it in 010 with the provided `Template/FXR3.bt`.
* HELP ME PLEASE OH GOD.
